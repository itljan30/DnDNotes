the medicine works a charm, oric and johnah are perfectly fine after like 30 minutes or something

we decide to check out the general store before continuing on our journey

we make it back to Frankton

seems like there's border searches in the towns near the borders, war has tightened security or something

audrick's favorite color is teal

we meet up with audrick, turns out she was robbed like a month ago so we are going to go and try to find the robbers
and at the very least get them to stop robbing people

we go to examine the area audrick got mugged, we also start to get mugged by the hobgoblins but then some human /
human adjacent people chase the hobgoblins away

we give chase too, we give echo greater invisibility and he trips one of the humans

turns out the humans are actually rat people??? and now we are in combat with a bunch of like hobgoblins
ogres and ratmen?
