#recap
We arrived at the Town of Wayside while helping Echo get some real world experience to aid his family, the Lasurifts, in their business (of being thieves). Upon arriving at Wayside, we stumbled upon Ben, the owner of the towns general store, and Cyndal Trueshot, a professional adventurer, arguing about what to do about their recent Chimera problem. After joining in on the conversation, we agreed to help with the chimera problem ourselves for a fee of 350 gold. Cyndal gave us a recipe for a potion called "Chimera's Bane" that would help us with getting rid of the chimera. After heading to Emberwhite Emporium, the local magic shop, we were able to get all the ingredients for the potion except for some goblin snot and muck root. To acquire those ingredients we went into the nearby forest where we encountered a group of goblins. We noticed that the goblin leader was an intelligent goblin who somehow managed to steal some of the chimera's eggs. After some peaceful negotiations with the intelligent goblin leader, we convinced them to give us their snot. As we were about to leave with our newly acquired goblin snot, Cyndal Trueshot showed up and started attacking the goblins leading to an all out battle. After killing all of the goblins except for the leader, we tied him up to question him on how he came across the chimera's eggs.
