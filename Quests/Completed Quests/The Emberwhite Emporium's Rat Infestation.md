- In order to brew the Chimera's Bane potions, the owner of the Emberwhite Emporium has asked us to get rid of a rat infestation that is blocking access to his ingredients.
- We tried to convince the rats to leave, with no luck.
- We were able to kill the rats and made sure there were no more coming.
