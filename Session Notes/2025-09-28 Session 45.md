I vomit all over the road (I rolled a nat 1 and a nat 3 con save)

then I find a comfy spot on the side of the road with some grass and try to fall asleep

I vomit all over Echo (I rolled a nat 1 and a nat 3 con save again ...)

we are using dnd 2024 rules for exhaustion

I try to sleep in because I'm hungover as fuck, Echo comes into my room and tries to wake me up but it doesn't work, he splashes cold water onto me ... wtf

I end up waking up and now we're heading over to the guard station

on the way we stop to get some potions

the potion shop was called "HP's Potion Shop"

I get a potion to cure my hangover and now I feel fuckin amazing

we fill out paperwork for like 2 hours

we receive news that the guard captain Nathan wants to talk to us, him and Miles were apparently talking about the crime network thing we're investigating or whatever

someone named Stewart was undercover at the attack in Nelivia, he was also at the colosseum and perished there

The Order of the Hand has a safe of documents on the 3rd floor, it's a 4 story building

Maroni is a name of someone in TOotH

we have decided to team up with the law enforcement to help them investigate Tooth since they are trying to uncover their other crimes as well. We are tasked with stealing some documents from Tooth that might be incriminating

they ask us to come back at 6
