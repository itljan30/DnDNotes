we're starting the session in combat with the goblins and company that were in the tents

- [x] Oric - bardic inspiration
- [x] Echo - silvery barbs bonus
- [x] Oric - bardic inspiration

Echo's mask gets a chip in it from an attack from an ogre

Oric hits 6 enemies with a lightning bolt (3 of which are slowed) and kills all but 2 ogres leaving them mortally wounded

Echo then goes on to kill one of the ogres and leaves the other one at like 1 hp or something

The next city we pass through will have a sewer grate that we need to talk to

Lunamen and Solalos are two different governmental bodies on either side of the border, not the same city split by the border

The town is called Thylos, is about a days worth of travel.

Echo rolled a 0 total on his night watch perception check ... bruh (above table, Star stole a bit of money from someone, not us)

Star was going to tell us something important (ADAM DON'T FORGET something about trade being closed off between Buna and Nelivia)
