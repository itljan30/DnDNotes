We decide to follow the river drop off point first

Ding leads us there.

Oric and Johnah have gone to follow the other lead so they are not with us

We go across a river, I fall in ... I'm wet and cold now ...

We're waiting near the dropoff point for about an hour to see if someone comes up

we notice two tracks coming out of the track, one heading towards the city the other heading south to who knows where.

we follow the south track and find a chest.

we open and it has a message saying "remember our deal"

it seems to have been here for like a week or so

The other path takes us to a warehouse.
