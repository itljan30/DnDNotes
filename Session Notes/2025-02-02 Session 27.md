We decide to follow the river drop off point first

Ding leads us there.

We go across a river, I fall in ... I'm wet and cold now ...

We're waiting near the dropoff point for about an hour to see if someone comes up

we notice two tracks coming out of the track, one heading towards the city the other heading south to who knows where.

we follow the south track and find a chest.

we open and it has a message saying "remember our deal"

it seems to have been here for like a week or so

The other path takes us to a warehouse.

there is a guy patrolling around the warehouse

this guy just completely ignores me? wtf sexist bitch

he laughs as I ask if he's sexist so I cast hideous laughter to give him something to laugh about

I punch mr. sexist he fails the saving throws again and is still laughing

we have now entered the warehouse and they seem to be confident that the specator incident was not connected to them

mr. sexist is named Dan

this group takes packages from kalle and the wastelands, but not from buna it seems

Sal is the leader guy, he's super into trading stocks

He's going to be changing his plan to be non war focused I guess or something I don't really remember
