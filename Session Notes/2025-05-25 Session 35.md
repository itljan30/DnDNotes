starting off form the combat from last time (a mud elemental popped out of the mud, I think I forgot to write that last time), we beat the shit out of it with pretty much nobody getting hit

a second one came out of the mud after we killed the first one

we make it to frankton

the town seems to be pretty swampy and uneven ground

tall buildings, some with walkways in the air that connect the upper floors of different buildings.

there is a travel ban between borders, don't know if that was already known

I've named the horse Robert now, we dropped him off at the stables

I get a private bath and relax

on the way into his private bath house stall, echo gets interrupted by someone claiming to be with the guild

he asks about some smaller thieves / assassins that would be around in Feland

one seems to work in beast smuggling, that's probably our target

Bram is the name of the town master in frankton

look into the 6 guilds, if they ask, we're not connected with this thieves guild

I'mma be honest, I haven't been paying much attention to this conversation, sorry D:
