Jenkins came to the room. Rimeia went into complete panic attack mode.

He told Oric about his scratch or more just hinted about it being important, wishing him luck in his sleep tonight.

Jenkins told us we need to get some coins tonight or there will be punishment or something

some intense conversations were had. Echo let out his frustrations on Rimeia. Oric gave a pep talk and convinced Rimeia that she isn't useless (at least on a tiny degree)

Echo is heading over to where the other thieves are to address the threat from Jenkins

Gerald Tommy Fork Brian and another named Sal and another named Dave are hanging out at the thieves hideout 

Echo convinced them to hand over their coins

Echo now heads over to Kyle

Echo convinces him to hand over information on Jenkins for free (and funding the next 5 thieves guild game thing)

there is going to be a meeting for the thief game held by Kyle to ambush Jenkins

Oric is having a dream of everyone of the thieves turning on us

Oric and Echo go to the church to find a cure for the exhaustion (that he got from not sleeping) and the wound.
