crow call from echo if he sees someone tailing us (ask for performance roll because funny)

ideas:
1. convince someone god is contacting them
	1. Oric's target
	2. I go invisible to push him as oric sends him the word of god
		1. find the guy and get him in a place where we can direct him into an alley
		2. I go invisible get close to him
		3. Oric messages the target with the word of god saying that the target is being led to a place to meet with gods disciple
		4. Oric uses silent alarm to signal when I should give him a slight push towards the alley
		5. Echo is on the rooftops waiting to drop down on this guy
		6. Echo convinces the target that for the small fee of a simple coin, this man can become one of gods strong and sexy and smart disciples too
2. make someone wear the lenses
	1. Echo's target
	2. we pretend to be salespeople and sell them the lenses that will make them have 'perfect vision'
	3. potion of mind reading
		1. I need to disguise myself
		2. oric disguise self
		3. oric and I are trench coat merchants and walk up to the target
		4. using the mind reading potion we convince this guy that we have the solution to his problems in the form on a lens that shows him the way towards the one he seeks most at this point in time
		6. we convince him it will hurt for 3 seconds but after that the location of the one he seeks will be crystal clear
		7. he puts the lens on
		8. Echo comes up behind the guy and picks the coin 


doesn't seem like high class and low class intermingle

we eat at a restaurant in the high borough section of town

Echo talks to a random noble looking guy at the tavern

sounds like he's the son of the Daggerfire family

place is mashed manuels

279 years ago the Daggerfire family settled into town financing the entire building of the town. Daggerfire xxxx year, something like 20-30 bottles left from that year

I spent 150 gold on the wine for echo to have
