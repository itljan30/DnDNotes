crow call from echo if he sees someone tailing us (ask for performance roll because funny)

ideas:
1. convince someone god is contacting them
	1. Oric's target
	2. I go invisible to push him as oric sends him the word of god
		1. find the guy and get him in a place where we can direct him into an alley
		2. I go invisible get close to him
		3. Oric messages the target with the word of god saying that the target is being led to a place to meet with gods disciple
		4. Oric uses silent alarm to signal when I should give him a slight push towards the alley
		5. Echo is on the rooftops waiting to drop down on this guy
		6. Echo convinces the target that for the small fee of a simple coin, this man can become one of gods strong and sexy and smart disciples too
2. make someone wear the lenses
	1. Echo's target
	2. we pretend to be salespeople and sell them the lenses that will make them have 'perfect vision'
	3. potion of mind reading
		1. I need to disguise myself
		2. oric disguise self
		3. oric and I are trench coat merchants and walk up to the target
		4. using the mind reading potion we convince this guy that we have the solution to his problems in the form on a lens that shows him the way towards the one he seeks most at this point in time
		6. we convince him it will hurt for 3 seconds but after that the location of the one he seeks will be crystal clear
		7. he puts the lens on
		8. Echo comes up behind the guy and picks the coin 

### Plans have been made, now we just act on them
doesn't seem like high class and low class intermingle

we eat at a restaurant in the high borough section of town

Echo talks to a random noble looking guy at the tavern

sounds like he's the son of the Daggerfire family

place is mashed manuels

279 years ago the Daggerfire family settled into town financing the entire building of the town. Daggerfire xxxx year, something like 20-30 bottles left from that year

I go to spend 150 gold on the wine for echo to have
owners name is torbird

I go to the back to evaluate the wine

Oric and Echo threaten the barkeep or whatever to make it only 110 gold so we don't have to pay as much

I get a message from Oric telling me to try to buy it for 110

I absolutely fail at convincing him so I strike a deal with him:
- I'll buy the wine for 200 gold and he tells everyone else that I was able to buy it for only 110

'what the dog doin' came from the Lasurift's area in the world

someone tries to steal from Echo but we all notice and stop him

Oric pretends to be an undercover guard as he pins the guy to the ground and steals his coin and paper while telling the crowd that we're just looking for identification

Oric's target is Gerwop

we look all over the town for Gerwop but can't find him

we eventually end up in the poorer part of town and ask around if anyone has seen him

we are told that he's probably in some underground bar and we get directions to it

we go there and ask the barkeep when he last saw the guy 

he doesn't want to tell us so I come up with some lie about us being friends and I've been looking everywhere for him but he ghosted me and I can't find him and I'm so frustrated oh my god where the fuck is he

he tells us where but has 2 of his guards follow us to make sure that no harm comes to Gerwop when we meet up with him

we see him, I try to convince the guards to leave because it's supposed to be a date with me and Gerwop, but they won't leave

Echo jumps down from the building (he was watching from above) without his armor on and covers himself in dirt so that he can distract the guards as a beggar

it doesn't really work so he purposefully fails at pickpocketing one of the guards and starts to get chased

as this is happening with everyone distracted I go invisible to chase our target and keep an eye on him

we roll initiative and end the session there
