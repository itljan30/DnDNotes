we make our way out of the cells to try to find Echo

we find him at the bathroom

alarms go off since they supposedly found the dead guy

guards are wrangling everybody up

we initiate combat and try to escape rather than trying to lie our ways out of this or anything

we are able to make our escape with only 4 casualties

we share the files with the guards

one of the files seems to eb a letter talking about the order to send the spectators, written in the handwriting of the King of Buna
