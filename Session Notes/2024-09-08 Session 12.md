dust of dryness 
- pouch that contains 8 pinches of dust, each pinch takes an action to sprinkle over water, up to 15 ft cubed, turns it into a pellet the size of a marble. you can then smash the pellet to turn it back into water

I tried to eat it, it was awful

lenses have something to do with light 
I see some smoke in the distance when taking out the lenses, just need to touch them I guess to activate them



echo put them on and sees pure white, brighter than the sun, he had to take take them off immediately

I'm going to put them on for 2 seconds longer than Echo because I'm better than him

DO NOT PUT THEM ON THEY HURT AS FUCK

they seem to magnify the sun as a death ray

abjuration scroll 
- protection spell
I gave it to oric since he's the only one that can use it

we continue our adventure and stumble upon
'DaggerFire' a city in the desert

we enter a tavern and refill on water and shit I guess

he tells us about a guild of thieves that he would like help iwth like eradicating or something?? 

anyway, I talk to some random guy on the street and ask him where the thieves guild is meeting and Echo followed up with thieves' cant and figure out the location of the meeting

they don't want me to be at the meeting but everyone else is allowed to go??? they said I was rude??? that's kind of mean to say that about me

I objected but nothing really happened and I said I would just be there anyway

echo reveals that he's a lasurift and scare the shit out of the poor guy

I showed a fake insignia that I made using song of creation claiming to be Echo's sister

meeting is tonight in old daggerfire, a cabin at the center of town

I also claimed to be in disguise and not actually a tiefling


I decided to show up under the invisibility spell since my claim of being a lasurift probably wouldn't go too well

meeting starts and a bunch of new thieves are intorduced to the group
