Frankton is about a day and a half away

Before leaving we notice that there is going to be a bit of a storm in about 5 hours\

we're going to get as much ground as we can before the storm starts

The storm seems to be unnatural

Rimeia and Johnah go on ahead with the horse to set up camp before the storm hits the forest

There seem to be about 3 figures that are controlling the storm

I ring the horn of silent alarm to make them aware of the danger

above table, the figures are air elementals

Oric knows what they are and knows that they are generally neutral

Oric also speaks their language

The air elementals say they found the storm and are just trying to keep it alive

Oric is able to convince them to move on without attacking 

During Echo's watch, there was a baby bear that came up to us, he fed it and the momma bear was angry, I wake up and convince it to leave at the expense of some of our food
