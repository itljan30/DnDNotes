this guy wants us to give him 10% of our profits??? what the fuck he's not my boss, I'm not even a part of his organization

Lar is the thief captain guy

let's go me and oric stole 2 bags of the thieves money right from under their nose while the meeting was going on, what losers

bags are 500 gold each

the games have begun

oric and I are together everyone else on their own

oric and I have the best plan omg
1. you get water from river
2. I track the guy
3. we meet back up
4. I talk to the guy try to seduce him
5. midway through I take the pellet and throw it up and run away
6. you freeze water
7. it knocks him out
8. we get his coin

Loga

pomni tried to put a ring of acid around him to give others a disadvantage in the fight. it didn't work so he just beat up his guy, tied him up and left him at his hotel

echo just stealthed up on his target and just ask for it nicely and it didn't work so he just chased him after him ended up asking again this time with intimidation, it didn't work so fighting commenced


OUR PLAN WENT PERFECTLY OMG Oric was super cool with an impromptu doctor that was super cool great improv
