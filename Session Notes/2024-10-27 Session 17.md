'audrick' tries to speak to us saying she's not audrick

we fail at some intimidation :(

we offer to give echo's coin in exchange for audrick back

15 left in the game

we have to resort to striking a deal with the guy where we have to win the game for him or something and in exchange he gives us Audrick back alive

mans name is Jenkins, he's always an optimist

Jenkins is also probably the invisible person that I somewhat bumped into during the game orientation

Leo has 2 siblings, I already forget their names though one was saito or something

Oric hears some commotion in the middle of his shift

he wakes up Echo and they go to see what it is

It looks like some announcer guy and a man named 'Ted' are stealing from someone for the game

Jenkins has won 3/5 of the past 5 thieving competitions

Jenkins camps out east of the military ward supposedly 

I went straight to go find Audrick. Oric came with me

I used 2 speak with animal spells to try to find her

one of the animals I came upon told me that they saw someone around the building directly east of the garrison? castle? whatever the gray structure was on the right side of the city map

I told Oric to wait there while I go to this building and try to see if she's there

I go invisible and manage to sneak my way into the building as an elderly women was making her way out of the building

we end my part for the session as I try to go to the basement. (I think it's locked? I already forget)


Echo makes his way to his targets address that he got from the group making noise last night

he sees a human who seems to be part of the game and tries to employ her help in finding Audrick

attempts to pay 100 gold for her help 

gotcha he spent 100 gold to buy the coin from her, she was Echo's target



if I see Audrick I need to use the horn of silent alarm to see if audrick reacts before I can fully go and hug her and pretty much fully sob lol
