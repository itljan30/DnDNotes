Adam is a bit under weather :( so sad

target of the guys we just killed was a guy named prat

we turned in the coins of the guys that attacked us as per the rules

the next hunter of pomni man 'knows their craft'

we keep watch over the night to make sure we don't get stolen from

someone came in during my watch, I turned invisible and used horn of silent alarm on oric to wake him up

we woke up to a goblin jump out of the window, I made him laugh and pomni grabbed onto him''


Jenkins is going after Pomni
he also always covers his face

we stole the goblins coins and stuff and then we turned it in
