we get let out about noon

they're getting a group of guards to visit the coliseum

evil adventuring party came through the other day with 5 halflings with them, turns out human trafficking

the guard who escorted us to the cafeteria and out of the building is Miles, he invites us to join in the visit to the coliseum, we'll be free to do what we want

because they're stronger pomni suggests to defeat them we have to fight dirty

list of people Pomni remembers:
	Commander Julian 
	Captain Gardner 
	Captain Joey 
	Captain Liu 
	Captain Lagu 
	Captain Chard 
	First Class Guardsmen Lucius

Pomni was able to escape by persuading Guardsmen Lucius to let him leave

Echo says he's going to train me to use a dagger while we wait, he goes and asks a guard around here if we could use their training room

he points us to the Brown Board Gym a few blocks away for us to train at

after my training we all meet up at the inn and tell (lie) about what happened to the inn keepers son (so he can move on believing the best)

the march on the colesium is at dawn so we retire for the night

I end up going to oric's room at night and sleep in his room to feel safe

we get up early and head on over to the meeting place

Captain James is the one we go to in order to get the okay to do illegal stuff such as murder of these stupid cringe guys from pomnis back story

it will take about 7 hours to get to the destination, we are traveling as a group with the gaurds
