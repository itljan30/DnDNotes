oh right, pomni man is now piss boy

echo get's dive bombed by a bird and catches it or something

'looks like they might be teaming up ... or something ... yada yada yada, get somewhere safe'

I enter the house (were backtracking a bit)

abandoned, but slightly cleaned up to be livable

1 floor house with basement

scattered around 10 gold worth of stuff 

damn got some fancy stuff in this house

dusty photograph
- 2 creatures
- goblins embracing eachother
- signed on it says "from your dearest Valentina"

3 room house
bedroom with slight bathroom

kitchen

family room

basement stairs are in the middle of the room, it is an oval

bookshelf with generic books

chairs coevered in soot

center is some tobacco and a few pipes (not touched in 1-5 years)

vault door type thing

on door are claw marks scratched into it

along the wooden unfinished walls

parchment on the ground by door

fuck fuck fuck fuck, 'she' saw me somehow, oh my god fuck fuck fuck, I must've made a noise or something I have to get away

I grab Oric and bolt as fast as I can

good thing I'm invisible I can potentially hid slightly away from the group and surprise this bitch

she put on some clawed gloves and beats the shit out of Oric 

she is now bming us by taking off her gloves and just back handing 

Oric is dying
