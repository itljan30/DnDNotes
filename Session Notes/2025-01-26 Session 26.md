the king is named King Daimien

the meeting with the king is at 10 am

we make it to the kings chamber

Francis is one of the kings guards

King Daimien is uncle of Echo (at least in name, not sure if it's blood related)

"never look a gift horse in the mouth" - insightful words of King Daimien

Ding is there at the meeting?

# RULES UPDATE
we are ruling it so silvery barbs doesn't work on natural 20s

ding's money is buried in the field by Toto (suburb of current location)

delieveries were given to him at the harbor at a secret location before being checked by customs

he was aware that his parckages were illegal but did it anyway

Echo is half Kalle (? country Ding is from)

2 leads 
- papers exchanged between Ding and other guy
