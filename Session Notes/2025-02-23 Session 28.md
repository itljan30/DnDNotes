Pomni man leaves us while we head back to town

we meet back up with Johnah and Ding at Ding's house

notes we found: 
- Long note on old parchment
- 3 word note saying only the time
- Note written out of newspaper letters bunched together (this is the most recent one)
- Cursive note written on clean printer style paper
- nearly illegible chicken scratch

The second note has an insignia when held up to the light. One that Echo does not recognize

Oric recognizes it as an insignia of a business that produces magical items somewhere in Northern Buna

This business is 11 days away by walking

newspaper one is probably related to the spectators

it says:
- pick up at 3:30 on the fourth day of the week, this one's a big one. use disgression

we head to the city archives to find copies that might match the clippings that were used to create the newspaper note. maybe we can find out where the creation might have been made.

there's conveniently a researcher who has been researching fonts in newspapers

It seems that the letter was made in Buna or at least using Buna newspapers

There's a town in Buna that this most likely originates from.

it's a town on the river Somme called <TBD>

It would take about 9.5 days to reach of hiking.
