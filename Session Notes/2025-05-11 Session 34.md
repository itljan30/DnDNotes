REMINDER: we are heading to Frankton to get more information from the thieves guild.  we are heading north to find out who sent the terrorist attack on Echo and I's home town

CANON: The world is not flat

we have a lovely conversation about our dreams from our very deep month long sleep

we come across a very muddy area that we attempt to bring our cart over, but we fail pretty badly at that so we ditch the cart.

Johnah is in charge of finding the best path while Oric helps her if she goes deep into the mud, and everyone else follows with me leading the horse
