about 5 and a halfish hours into the journey some guy wearing the colloseums garb beckons towards our group secretly

Echo goes to talk to the guy stealthily but gets seen by Miles, we're able to convince him that it 100% isn't the enemy and stuff so he's not worried

Echo, while heading towards the guy, sees a child no older than 9

the guy tries to convince echo to watch his "child" while he "takes a piss"

The man bolts away as he's walking away from echo to do business, Echo bolts after him

Pomni remembers taht this man is Joey, he was a guardsmen but is now a captain judging by his uniform, after a little while

Captain Joey is the one Pomni got to smuggle him out of the colloseum but also pomni kinda scammed joey out of a bit of money

Echo yells at the guy as he runs away so we all hear and come to his aid

the child is named Seth

Seth recognizes pomni

seth was only at the camp for a day

apparently pomni is a hero or something among the people there

Pomni won a lot of battles without killing anyone according to seth

Seth is from a town in Buna

we are now roughly 45 minutes away form the coloseum

echo and 2 stealthy guards go ahead and scout for us (Fain and Luigi)

they come across the trail of joey as we has running back

the colesium seems to be pretty makeshift, made of sticks and seems to be abel to be put together and taken apart quickly
