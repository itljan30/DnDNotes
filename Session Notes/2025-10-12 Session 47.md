Echo runs to the guard station to get some guards to detain Dan, he gets 2 new members Eileen and Frodo

we head back to the inn to get a night's rest and then get back to staking this place out 

we watch as a cart approaches the building - they knock on the door and it just opens and lets them in (probably won't work for us because they were probably expecting this cart)

the cart seemed to contain foodstuffs and maintenance supplies

there are various people coming in and out of the building, none that Echo recognizes

the people we saw in the building last night is probably all the people that live there

Echo sees a message on the spellcasters table that says "Meet with head of guild [yesterdays date] she'll be disguised in the office at 5 pm"

Echo stays hidden the entire time up until he exits as his invisibility turns off, he gets spotted and falls 

there are 4 bosses,

Vincent and Mohammad are not one of them

in Echo's infiltration he picks up a jounral
- not much information gleaned from it other than the fact that the owner is most likely not one of the people with any sort of password or the ability to open the innermost door

Echo tells us about:
- the blueprint - found in mechanics office
- the sticky note - "Find a way to sneak the supervisor out for their meeting with Ron Robinson, make sure no one realizes that they are the boss"
- Kiara's journal - nothing of value, probably rules her out, does talk about a few other supervisors Evangeline Luke and Jerry are unmentioned, probably means nothing, but maybe Kiara avoided writing about the one that has the information?
