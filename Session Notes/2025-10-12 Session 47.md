Echo runs to the guard station to get some guards to detain Dan, he gets 2 new members Eileen and Frodo

we head back to the inn to get a night's rest and then get back to staking this place out 

we watch as a cart approaches the building - they knock on the door and it just opens and lets them in (probably won't work for us because they were probably expecting this cart)

the cart seemed to contain foodstuffs and maintenance supplies

there are various people coming in and out of the building, none that Echo recognizes

the people we saw in the building last night is probably all the people that live there

Echo sees a message on the spellcasters table that says "Meet with head of guild [yesterdays date] she'll be disguised in the office at 5 pm"

Echo stays hidden the entire time up until he exits as his invisibility turns off, he gets spotted and falls 

there are 4 bosses,

Vincent and Mohammad are not one of them

in Echo's infiltration he picks up a jounral
- not much information gleaned from it other than the fact that the owner is most likely not one of the people with any sort of password or the ability to open the innermost door

Echo tells us about:
- the blueprint - found in mechanics office
- the sticky note - "Find a way to sneak the supervisor out for their meeting with Ron Robinson, make sure no one realizes that they are the boss"
- Kiara's journal - nothing of value, probably rules her out, does talk about a few other supervisors Evangeline Luke and Jerry are unmentioned, probably means nothing, but maybe Kiara avoided writing about the one that has the information?


## The Plan
1. We are interested in joining TOotH so we did a little demo of our skills in order to increase the chances they let us join:
	1. We broke into the building and found out who the top amongst the supervisors was
	2. We recorded their voice using the device that we have
	3. We then had someone go in and use gaseous form to fit through the vent that leads passed the 2nd door
	4. using the device we were able to open the vault door
	5. we stole the documentation regarding the delivery of the creatures that were sent to Nelivia
	6. upon leaving our guy got seen leaving the building (adding credibility that we were actually there)
2. we work with the guards to make the most believable fake documentation we can about the Nelivia stuff
3. now that we have stolen the documentation we head to the building and ask to speak with the highest supervisor or perhaps a council of their supervisors since they won't want to share who the top is
4. we explain that we are a vigilante group that specializes in breaking and entering
5. we show the documentation that we stole to back up our skills
6. after the meeting Echo and I stay together while I upcast invisibility on both of us for up to 4 hours of invisibility (we could hide in a closet or something to stop the need to upkeep it 4+ hours straight)
7. Echo steals the real documentation that the guards need to incriminate TOotH
