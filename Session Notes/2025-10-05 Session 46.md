after some dilly dallying for about 5 hours we come back to the guard house for a debriefing on the heist

6 guard patrols, 3 persons each, swaps every 4 hours

make their way from bottom of building to top of building back to bottom of building while double pacing the 3rd floor each time

shouldn't be too hard to slip passed them, real concern is there's a door that we need a guardsmen insignia in order to get passed some magic stuff

next obstacle is another door that we need a password for that only the top 10 or so ranking men have access to

in that door we make it into the vault, we don't know what's inside there really, but there is a safe and in order to get into it it needs to hear the voice of the commander (maybe it wasn't commander or something?) of TOotH, no idea who that is though it could be anyone

basically we might need a recording of the right persons voice saying the right words in order to get in the safe

Phil is our ally now who has been working with magic users to get a device that will allow us to recreate someone's voice if they speak into it for 2-3 minutes

the inner vault needs to be properly air controlled so they have an air duct leading into it, only 4x4 inches though so hard to squeeze in, but if we do it skips the first 2 steps

no known way to get passed the 3rd voice identification thing

our guy lives inside the building but there's like 10 people that do

any gold we find is ours to keep

building is made of concrete

2 entrances, main door and a side bigger door for hauling things in I guess

1st floor - most of the maintenance stuff is, kitchen, dining hall, broom closet (this ending is my favorite)

2nd floor - bedrooms

3rd floor - vault and protection of said vault

4th floor - meeting / office floor


there is a building that we could climb to get to a 2nd floor window of the building

Buna operates on 8 hour shift with vacation days and weekends are usually off

David Rogers is Dan's supervisor, Dan believes that David probably has the secret code for the door

he works with Chris (who lives there) and Michael (who commutes)

we send Echo to head over to get the guards to arrest Dan, Oric bounds and gags him too

RETCON: we only need the voice of the specific person to open the inner most door, not that and a password (or maybe that person saying the code of honor or whatever)
