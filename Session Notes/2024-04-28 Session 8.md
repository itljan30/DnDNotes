CANON: These cultists are against swearing

warlocks

hunting trap DESTROYED that one cultists, poor guy

probably no to using hunting trap like that, can't create something inside an occupied space so I wouldn't be able to set the chain in the ground. could probably still do everything with it but stopping the movement fully

alistair statute:
- small humanoid shapes on statue represent suffering people

Glom:
 - keeper of the treasures

plaque on statue of alistair
- Do not fear fear
- Fear is a way of life
- Power removes the requirement for fear

small room 2 cultists one high and one lower came out with high priest guy giving the small guy a  lecture

poor cultist was fearing the fear, sounds like he went against the cult

initiation includes spilling blood on a dais

room of horrors

yikes echo can not read people
stopped by the highest of priests echo failed deception check

have the face of glam in memory

got to what looked like a main praying chamber or something and 
all of the cultists ran out in a hurry

passed the praying chamber there are broken down doors, looks like a monster was rampaging here

scratch marks all around

culprit: shadow creature

shadow creature:
- man made it seems
- addicted to strange green fluid

echo made it passed without getting spotted and grabbed the book and some loot that is yet to be determined

shadow creature is called a growth

echo is barely barely alive, almost fully died (should have if we went rules as written but you know)

looted the treasure trove (TBD) and made our way back to Montopia
