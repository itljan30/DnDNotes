loud bells ring while we are asleep

the inn keeper tells us that it means the monestary is in trouble and he requests us to go there to save his son

we arrive to a bunch of idiot bandit guys raiding the monestary

we start combat

the main bandit guy recognizes Pomni

Pomni recognizes him too, it was before Pomni woke up in whatever place he did in his past, he remembers that voice and that mask barking orders at him
