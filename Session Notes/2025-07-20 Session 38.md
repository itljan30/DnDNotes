loud bells ring while we are asleep

the inn keeper tells us that it means the monestary is in trouble and he requests us to go there to save his son

we arrive to a bunch of idiot bandit guys raiding the monestary

we start combat

the main bandit guy recognizes Pomni

Pomni recognizes him too, it was before Pomni woke up in whatever place he did in his past, he remembers that voice and that mask barking orders at him

the inn keepers son died :/

part way through the combat there is a horn that is blown from a distance, one of the bandits assumes it is the guards coming here

"make the pain last" is said by the big bandit leader guy as he is running away or at least his plan was to run away but Pomni stunned him for the 3rd or 4th time this fight
