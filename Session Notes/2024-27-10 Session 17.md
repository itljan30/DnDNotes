'audrick' tries to speak to us saying she's not audrick

we fail at some intimidation :(

we offer to give echo's coin in exchange for audrick back

15 left in the game

we have to resort to striking a deal with the guy where we have to win the game for him or something and in exchange he gives us Audrick back alive

mans name is Jenkins, he's always an optimist

Jenkins is also probably the invisible person that I somewhat bumped into during the game orientation

Leo has 2 siblings, I already forget their names though one was saito or something

Oric hears some commotion in the middle of his shift

he wakes up Echo and they go to see what it is

It looks like some announcer guy and a man named 'Ted' are stealing from someone for the game

Jenkins has won 3/5 of the past 5 thieving competitions

Jenkins camps out east of the military ward supposedly
