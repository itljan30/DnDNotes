Rockshasas have backwards hands

we pay the enchanter guy 400 gold

as we leave the castle, Leo flies super fast towards us in a very panicked state

disputed land at north of map is because the border was stated to be the river, but an earthquake moved the river and now disputes on who gets which land

we're headed to Hartstrum capital of Nelivia
- heart of nelivia
- heart of the nation

Audricks been getting around while we've been gone ;)

she takes us to a stall or shop or something and gets us some food for our sudden trip

we get 5 packs of food, for 5 gold total for a 'friend'

Paul is the driver

guards of the lazurift :
1. Swanson: died in front of us as we arrive at the keep

on the way to Celeste's quarters we meet a goliath named Cobalt (I know of him)

Celeste is out on a mission with Echo's sister (Aya)

we approach the throne room and see 6 attackers

we see an earth genasi paladin (our new party member joining the game she is enemy right now)

Lord Sanzu Lazurift, his wife Constance, Saito a highly ranked assassin in the family

Sanzu and Constance are Echo's parents

Sanzu just cut off this dudes hand holy shit

Sanzu just got his arm cut off!!! echo's dad might die uh oh

echo killed on of the enemies

Sanzu is incapacitated now

Sanzu is dead now :(

He tells us to not retaliate with force and that we should maintain the peace between this Nelivia and Buna

Sanzu has now been decaptiated, he is dead now for sure 100% rip

this paladin girl is turning on her friends????? 
Johnah was under the impression that this was just about freeing the people from a corrupt lord, not about war. she has turned on her friends now.

Echo is crying holding his fathers head ... 

Everyone but Echo have left the room to leave him be for a bit and guard the door

we can hear and see some other bandit guys / soldiers of Buna are all over the castle / keep

the lords guards have arrived and the soldiers leave

we spend a few days in waiting for the meeting with the king
