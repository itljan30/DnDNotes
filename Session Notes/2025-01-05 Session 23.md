Captain Song(?) comes in and talks to Echo about preparing his father for burial

Guards get Sanzu's body and take him away for processing

Constance comes back and is distraught at the sight of a gory Sanze

After she leaves towards her quarters we interrogate Johnah

Echo be mad, what's up with that?

King Damien - King of Buna (or whatever side we're on, I'll get it eventually)

Man who hired Johnah has an accent from the southwestern area of Buna

This war is over the Disputed Triangle, the area that was up for air on who owns it because of river change or whataver

Sounds like the next step is getting an audience with the King to talk about our next steps with this (basically) declaration of war

Fitzroy is new captain of the front gates since poor old Swanson died in battle

Okay, now the guards come for Sanzu's body, I guess it wasn't his body they grabbed first

Fitzroy meets as we go to leave to lead us to our rooms
