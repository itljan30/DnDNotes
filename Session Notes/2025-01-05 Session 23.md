Captain Song(?) comes in and talks to Echo about preparing his father for burial

Guards get Sanzu's body and take him away for processing

Constance comes back and is distraught at the sight of a gory Sanze

After she leaves towards her quarters we interrogate Johnah

Echo be mad, what's up with that?

King Daimien - King of Buna (or whatever side we're on, I'll get it eventually)

Man who hired Johnah has an accent from the southwestern area of Buna

This war is over the Disputed Triangle, the area that was up for air on who owns it because of river change or whataver

Sounds like the next step is getting an audience with the King to talk about our next steps with this (basically) declaration of war

Fitzroy is new gatehouse captain of the front gates since poor old Swanson died in battle

Okay, now the guards come for Sanzu's body, I guess it wasn't his body they grabbed first

Fitzroy meets as we go to leave to lead us to our rooms

Fun fact of the day: we are in the middle of summer

we are escorted to some rooms

we eventually fall to sleep

we get to a meeting in the morning

Constance and Saito are already in the room discussing something as we get there

Saito hands a piece of paper over to Echo saying 
"THE TIME FOR PEACE IS OVER! It's finally time to fight back [artists rendition of Lasurift keep in flames]"

These papers are all over the town

Constance seems to have a safe house already, and the rest of their money is going to paying staff

that place is called:
Nam-Su - comes from the old language, before Common it symbolizes a place of rebirth and healing.

We made a promise to save as many people as possible if things turn to war

We are now called "Obsidian Ravens" officialy

we gambled, echo won (we each put 10 gold in)
