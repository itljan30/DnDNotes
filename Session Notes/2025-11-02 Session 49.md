guards taking is are Stewart and Bionca

Echo and I go outside (Echo invisible) 

The crown will be picking up the letter at around 7 am

Isobel is the crown

Echo is able to get a recording of her voice and goes to steal the actual papers from the vault

there is a guard there when he gets in there who Echo thinks is another thief that is there trying to steal rather than just increased security

Echo kills the guard and opens the safe to steal the documents

I can sense that Echo dropped his invisibility and we freak out
