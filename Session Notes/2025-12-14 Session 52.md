continuing the fight

Johnah slices the belly 

we finish the fight

turns out tooth took the guard station area hostage or something asking where we were, we need to leave town now

on our way trying sneak out of town we are followed, I try to lose them but end up in a dead end

I'm able to deceive them into thinking we are just lookalikes to this crazy Obsidian Ravens or whatever

they follow us to our "inn" where I'm able to get the bar owner to help us out and lie on our behalf

we are able to convince them that we are not those they seek

in order to avoid these guys further we stay at the inn staying in the owners guest room 

The plan is to have everyone not be drunk and then we can actually make our way out of the city successfully

while Oric and Johnah sleep Echo and I spend the night bonding and forgetting about our worries while we enjoy eachothers company (I guess)

right before we go to sleep Echo hears an argument between the bar keep and what is probably a member of the tooth

Stauton's inn
