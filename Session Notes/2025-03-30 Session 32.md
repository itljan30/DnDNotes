Star let's us know that there has been updates, Buna and Nelivia have no trade, no movement, nothing

we disguise Echo so Echo and Johnah can buy some clothes

Echo and Johnah just stay at an inn to grab some alcohol and food for us

the thieves guild is called the order of the hand

we go to meet the thieves guild here, Star leads the way

the man there is a scrawny man about 65 years old

LORE: Nelivia has cabinets in their government

 We'll pass a small town on the way to Feland called Frankton that will initiate us into the guild
