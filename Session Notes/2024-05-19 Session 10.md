lily fuckin died when lily and gigget were ambushed by bandits

gigget barely survived, got over his thing quickly happened 2.5 days ago, lily can't be saved :(

bought the room for another day so oric can stay while hungover

guy next door said something about much more bandit attacks recently
guy next door has a connection to them


guys brother was on the guard, he's struggling because of his brothers stories??? I guess???

we went off to get revenge on lily, ran into some guards that would not let us pass

I went invisible the others convinced the guards to let them through by giving an 'autograph' or something (signing a document that has which people leave, echo put 'asshole' in elvish)

come across a stream 4 feet deep 10 feet across, 

we made it across, asked some snakes where the bandits are

bandits have bandanas, leaders have red ones or something (super original)


bandit camp had 5 foot high walls around and small gate

temporary fortification

there's at least 4 bandits

echo is going to sneak in while everyone else pretends to be wanting to join the bandits

one bandit leader is red the other is blue (bandanas)

echo walks in on a conversation
they were questioning whether 'new blood' would be good enough to join them

pomni easily beat someone up

I made someone laugh 

gigget shot a rock that was thrown with eldritch blast

me and pomni try to kill the two that we fought while everyone else goes inside, the leader looks back, gigget tries to attack the leader, misses completely, initiative has been rolled

bandit camp had 11 total

gigget is not doing well, echo is rolling low on attacks I rolled low on dissonant whispers damage this is not going well

pomni man did 22 damage plus 4 from my inspiration in one turn to the leader killing her

the scroll of confusion only got one guy :(

I made a boulder in the gates to funnel the bad guys and then pomni man just runs inside anyway, at least it blocks cover for me and giggett

after killing the bandits we find a letter from 'Trogdor'

'your goal is to attack the belly as much as possible, make them weak, our plans require this. I will send more information soon' (or something like that anyway)
