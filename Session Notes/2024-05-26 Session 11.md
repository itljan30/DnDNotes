made our way back to montopia passing the same guards as last time

we made our way to the inn where we left oric

giggett met oric what a difference in height

we shoped around, didn't get much and made our way to the source of the magic on audrick with audrick

on the first day we came across some kobolds

karg kobold giggett talked to

we absolutely decieved them into thinking giggett was leading us to a trap he set ahead. he was disguised as a kobold

2nd day: found a cave, snuck past a few hobgoblins? to get to their treasure while invisible

I lied and told the rest of the party I found nothing, they all beleived me

found a sign for a city called Groop

inside the bag I found
- mystery dust - transmutation
- mystery potion (potion of force resistance)
- dark lenses (sunglasses?) - transmutation
- mystery scroll - abjuration
- assorted items that appear to be worth about 20-30 gold each 
1. black mask
2. small mirrors
3. ^ x2
4. bone dice
5. 2 silver ewers
6. small gold bracelet

I gave 50 gold to oric and tried to give 50 to audrick but she was mad??? I thought no one cared about gold??? it's not that big a deal???????????????????????????????????


(hob)goblin tried to steal back its stuff while I was sleeping, echo saw it and intervened

guy was called 'star' and part of an unorganized organized crime group

I think they were just goblins

potion of force resistance
