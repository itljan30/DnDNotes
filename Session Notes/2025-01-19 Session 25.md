we need to get to Ding at about like 2:30 or something, 15 minute walk from where we are and it's in 2 hours

we make our way to go check on Oric again at the keep, we get there at 12:45

we start to head out for a tavern to kill some time

maybe I can use alcohol to help steel my nerves to talk to Oric

it seems to be attached or connected to the lasurifts. 

kind of a smaller tavern, more expensive for non lasurifts I guess or something

orc and halfling there

people seem to be cautious of Echo now after his thing with the protestors

we're warned not to threaten the other patrons, echo has such a reputation now

there's also an elf that echo knows that's here

elf is named Dave

bartender said that alcohol is a bad idea for this conversation ... what am I going to do?????? I don't know if I'll ever be able to do this

elf thinks that we should be going to war and is upset about Sanzu's plans to not retaliate

we meet up with the guards outside Ding's place

I make Echo invisible and he goes in first. sees a guy

we all go in

the guy tries to go past the guards, but I use hideous laughter on him to make him fall prone laugh obviously. Everyone is mad at me now, but He was walking towards the guards, who knows if he was going to attack or run away ... whatever, I don't care anymore

Mr. Ding Morecan(Lorecan? Borcan? idk?)

captian Catarina and captain Arch

Ding is claiming he got a package from a new person to put the cages at his stall and that's it

he has papers to prove it

he just needed rent money

note is written from buna specifically from the Buna mafia type organization (thieves network)

Johnah does not want to let this person go, she thinks hes dangerous

Ding is going to be held by the guards for a bit. Rimeia and Johnah leave for the keep while Echo and Oric go to buy Oric an enchanted dagger

Blorbo is the best potion maker in town
