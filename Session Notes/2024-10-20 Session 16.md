we started in initiative

I am just following this target man

Oric and Pomni are with the 2 guards

Echo was able to steal some gold from one to get his attention then run away with it

he left it on a barrel as he was running away though so the guard can still pay rent

Echo succesfully got away 

theres a threat of war right now, I don't remember if this is new information

target is a half elf

one of the guards from the hold in the wall is brode and the other is Craig 

Gerwop's target was a halfing named fork

OPERATION HOLY MESSAGE WAS A HUGE SUCCESS!!!! LET'S GOOOOO

Oric spoke the gen z (or whatever it is) language and 'tawk tuah'd' the thief leader and turned in the coin. I'm so glad I wasn't there to experience the brain rot

Leo (echo's bird) doesn't remember me :( we met like once before apparently
