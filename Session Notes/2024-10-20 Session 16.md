we started in initiative

I am just following this target man

Oric and Pomni are with the 2 guards

Echo was able to steal some gold from one to get his attention then run away with it

he left it on a barrel as he was running away though so the guard can still pay rent

Echo succesfully got away 

theres a threat of war right now, I don't remember if this is new information

target is a half elf

one of the guards from the hold in the wall is brode and the other is Craig 

Gerwop's target was a halfing named fork

OPERATION HOLY MESSAGE WAS A HUGE SUCCESS!!!! LET'S GOOOOO

Oric spoke the gen z (or whatever it is) language and 'talk tuah'd' the thief leader and turned in the coin. I'm so glad I wasn't there to experience the brain rot

Leo (echo's bird) doesn't remember me :( we met like once before apparently

we got back to our room to have some of that fine wine that we got. 

Audrick wasn't being herself and I was able to figure out that 
it actually wasn't her because of my insane insight

we are trying to grapple her now to steal back the coin that they probably stole from Pomni. That or they're just running now that they have been caught

Pomni was able to pin the guy down, oric went to help him. 

They were able to keep the guy on the ground 

that is where we end the session
