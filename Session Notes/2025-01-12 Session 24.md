after gambling:
- crowd is gathered chanting something
- chanting "respect his legacy: Sanzu didn't die for this: we don't deserve to lose: our money is not for you"

they seem to be protesting the gambling thing saying it's "stealing from the poor"

Echo threatens to slaughter everyone that isn't leaving the property

I attempt to calm him down and walk him away from it

we go to sleep and wake up to a letter that was slid underneath all of our doors.

it is a formal invitation for everyone in our party to join the meeting with the king as well.

we get interupted in the middle of eating by some guy running into the cafeteria place yelling about some beast going wild further into the town.

we go there and fight some spectators (mini beholders)

pomni breaks the second one out of it's cage

rugs are being sold at the place where we fought the spectators, guess the rug market is booming right now or something, maybe I should invest?

Rimeia goes back to the castle to make sure Oric is ok, everyone else goes to tell the guards about the information we know about this. 

The rugs around the stall of the Spectator seems to be from around Johna's home country

I sneak into orics room while he's still asleep and use my healing spell on him

I hope he gets better soon :( I know we're kind of awkward together right now, but he is still my dear friend

There's more people chanting outside now, more than last time

they're chanting about removing all the Bunites

we go around trying to find information about the stall owner

I find someone who gives me their name Ding and a physical description and where to find information on them

guard captains name is Arch(?)
