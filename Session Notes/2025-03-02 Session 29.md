Feland is the name of the city that we're heading 

we make our way to the king

king is talking to one of his advisors

we meet a guard name steadman? he got our carriage set up for us, the king had to be somewhere else

we leave the city

we see a woman in bright clothing waving us down on the side of the road

I had my fortune told, something about betrayal and not fun things and success after a bunch of fallbacks ... umm that was not a very fun

pomni had visions of an old friend / lover coming back and pain and loss and a reunion that may be more bittersweet than expected and growth and learning and DEATH AND BLOOD AND MURDER but ... not bad? from Pomni? he's happy about it? uhhhhhhhh it had to be done? .......... is this person really legit? what the fuck are they talking about? surely we're not all bad fortunes???? ??????????

Oric - family, a man close to Oric, trying to help but unable. they want to be in his life again, they have information, a tool, something important. he's nervous about something. There's a conflict within Oric, something he thought was true turns out to not be (uhhh woops) 

I steal 10 gold from her (that pomni gave as extra for free?) and got cursed by the bitch. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH HER!!!!! 

We reach a city on the border, Lunamen, the next day
