#creature
Plant-like creatures encountered on the roads between the [[Town of Wayside]] and [[Montopia]]. Deadly yet relatively common creatures found in this area. It is said that if you cook one of these on the night of a blue moon, it grants power for a short while.

Mandrakes use their shrikes to poison their foes and use their vines as whips.
