Goblins are humanoid creatures that are typically rather dumb. These creatures fight in groups so as to appear stronger than they really are.

The first goblin our party encountered was unusually smart. We were able to communicate with it and convince it that we were allies, however [[Cyndal Trueshot|Cyndal]] decided to ruin that by attacking one of its friends without warning during [[The Chimera Incident]].
