coffee originates from the wasteland continent and is only really in the northern parts of Uracel

The thieves guild that Echo "joined" a while ago is called and has definitely always been called "The Black Mushroom"

we started the day by going to a coffee shop to try to take Echo's mind off things, then we go to a bar where everyone except for me gets hammered

on the way home we get attacked by some thugs who nearly kill me but we should be fine ... hopefully
