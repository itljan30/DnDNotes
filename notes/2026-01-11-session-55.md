we succeded in killing the enemies

we see no sign of anything stolen here

the place we ended up fighting is some sort of old underground area of the city
the place we ended up in seems to be a school
specifically the room they ended up in seems to be a rec room

something about finding pomni and seth trapped inside the wall (since he's joining
back in the group)
