continuing combat

oric thunder stepped away and did damage to everyone ... ow that hurt a lot

we are almost all about to die the situation is very dire (elks are strong D:)

well the hobgoblins died and the elk ran away so I guess we're fine ...

we rest up and finish our trek to solalos and lunamen

we go to "the noblemans pocket" inn that's high end
