we sleep for the night to recover and then we make our way out of the city, onwards to the border

we use the cover story that we are visiting a passed family member of Johnas to get into thylos

there seems to be less people exploring here than last time we were here, everyone is on edge

there's a bathhouse called "The Fresh Towel"

all of us but pomni and seth go out to find some pristine grass for the GOAT

star tries to steal from me during the night whithout realizing its me
I tell him that echo died and that I'm with a new crew, 
johna is now josha, johnahs sister that was separated at birth
oric disguised self into essentially echo but named echa
both are using southern accents (from southern buna)
echo is invisible with us being a ghost essentially

magician's taste bud is the restaurant we go to

after some terrorizing him we finally tell him the truth

he tells us that it's near impossible to get through the border without official government documents
so we are probably going to have to go with our thieves guild connections to go through an underground path
