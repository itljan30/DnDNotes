we meet a strange old woman on our way to solalos, we gave her some food and drink and she offered some magic in return
but we had no use for that

we meet another travelling group travelling from soren to solalos

soren is a city of art

we agree to be guard them for the rest of the journey to Solalos to make some money

we come across a group of rampaging elks being chased by 2 hobgoblins so we're fighting them now I guess
