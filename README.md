This is my notes as a player in a home game of Dungeons and Dragons. If you are here and not part of our game, welcome!
I don't know why you're here, but feel free to look around. I take notes using Obsidian using a plugin to automatically
push my notes to github. I also use a plugin to automatically make table of content like files that have links to all files in 
a specific directory. The only part of my notes that are being maintained right now are the files in the 'Session Notes'
directory. I do plan on eventually going back and updating it to be more of a compendium for our game, but as of now
I'm not working on that.
