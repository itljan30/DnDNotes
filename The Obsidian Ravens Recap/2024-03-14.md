#recap
After Cyndal was escorted to the city's jailhouse, one of her companions, Audrick, a mut Tiefling, got our attention and asked us to help restore their voice. In order to do that we need to head to the city of Montopia, where we will find a wizard that will be able to restore Audrick's voice. After a quick shopping session at Ben's Bargain, we set off on the road. While on the road we ran into a group of monsters that were blocking our path and we decided to fight rather than run or hide.
