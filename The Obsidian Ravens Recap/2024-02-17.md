#recap 
The questioning with the goblin leader did not go well, he refused to give us information about the eggs, so we killed him. When we arrived back at Wayside, we talked with the owner of the Emberwhite Emporium and paid to have him brew the Chimera's Bane for us so we didn't screw it up. After that, we went to the nearby tavern where we saw Cyndal once more. We talked to her and enjoyed time in the tavern for a couple of hours. We then went back to the Emberwhite Emporium to see if our potion had been brewed yet. Instead of having our potion finished, it turns out he wasn't even able to start because he had some sort of rat infestation going on in his basement where he did all of his potion brewing. We decided to help him with his infestation and made our way into his basement. After speaking with some of the rats we decided the only way to get them to leave was to attack. After a very difficult battle against the Rat King (the rats were a really easy fight, there was no rat king) we went back upstairs to inform the owner of the store that the rats were taken care of. On the way up the stairs, we noticed that the raven familiar of the owner was down in the basement with us, meaning the owner was likely watching the fight from upstairs. After being told the potion was going to be ready by tomorrow morning, we made our way back to the tavern where we spent the rest of the day drinking and playing darts.
