#recap
We were abruptly woken up by the sounds of panic outside. After making our way outside, we were greeted with a very panicked Ben, turns out the chimera was currently setting his crops ablaze. After quickly picking up our Chimera's Bane potions, we headed out to his field to confront this chimera, but there was no chimera to be found. Instead we found Cyndal and her group hurriedly packing up a cart with Ben's crops. After confronting them we found out that there was, in fact, no chimera. It was all a lie in order for Cyndal to steal Ben's crops and resell them elsewhere to make some quick money. Also, it turns out that Ben's crops were called Heroes Wort and actually acted as some sort of drug. As the conversation went on, it almost broke out into a fight. However, before either side could strike, a roar was heard from the distance. Turns out that the fake chimera was in fact not fake. What a terrible coincidence. We had a small cease-fire with Cyndal's group so that we could take care of this chimera together. After killing the chimera, Cyndal decided that she was done with a life of crime and chose to turn herself in.
