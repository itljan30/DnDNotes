#recap
After a terrifying confrontation with these creatures, we found out that they are monsters known as Mandrakes. While they were a tough opponent, we were able to take them out without much harm coming to us. After traveling for a few more days, we finally arrived at Montopia where we were met by a guard. After Echo told the guard that we were here to find a blacksmith, he gave us an info dump on the city, it's businesses, and it's history.
