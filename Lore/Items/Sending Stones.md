Sending stonesÂ come in pairs, with each smooth stone carved to match the other so the pairing is easily recognized. While you touch one stone, you can use an action to cast an altered version of the [[Sending]] spell from it. The target is the bearer of the other stone. If no creature bears the other stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone and don't cast the spell.

If one of the stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes nonmagical.
