You can use your bonus action to smoke this cigarette to gain a +3 bonus to your proficiency for the next 10 minutes.


##### Excerpt from the book (we did a little homebrew):

*This plant, a hybrid spliced together and then imbued with arcane energy through the transitive properties of [[Ben]]'s absent-minded bardic humming, is more than it appears. Incredibly filling when consumed as part of a light salad or as feed for cattle, it reduces the need for food, sating even the most voracious appetites for 12 hours. When smoked, however, the plant’s botanical underpinnings are activated in a different way, granting any who inhale the vapors released by igniting it a more established sense of self. This alteration is mental and physical, manifesting in a +3 to proficiency until the start of one’s next turn. Inhaling Heroes’ Wort as part of a rolled cigarette or pipe requires a bonus action.*
